# Garbage Image Classification with MobileNetV2 (Jupyter Notebook)

This project is designed to classify trash images into 7 different categories using the **MobileNetV2** model. The dataset is modified to classify only 7 of 10 classes, which the original dataset is hosted on **Kaggle**. This modified dataset consists of images categorized into the following classes: **Battery**, **Biological**, **Cardboard**, **Clothes**, **Metal**, **Shoes**, and **Trash**.

## Features
- **MobileNetV2 Model** for image classification.
- 7 identified trash classes: **Battery**, **Biological**, **Cardboard**, **Clothes**, **Metal**, **Shoes**, and **Trash**.
- Full dataset for training and evaluating the model.
- Ideal for implementing automatic trash sorting systems.

## Dataset

The original dataset used for training the model is **Garbage Classification v2**, and it can be downloaded directly from Kaggle.
